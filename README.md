# HealthSteward

> **Privacy-first AI agent for fragmented care.**
> Your health is split across multiple specialists on different systems, none talking to each other.
> HealthSteward centralizes it — locally, on your machine — and prepares you for every appointment.

---

No cloud storage. No sync. Your health data never leaves your machine.
PDF parsing runs on local Ollama. PII is stripped before anything touches an external model.

## Motivation

Managing a chronic illness means managing a second, unpaid job: remembering what each specialist said, what changed since the last visit, which labs are still pending, and what you're supposed to bring up next time, across providers who don't talk to each other and often don't share a health system.

That coordination work doesn't show up on any chart. Nobody on the clinical side owns it. It falls entirely on the patient, and it falls hardest exactly when a patient has the least capacity to carry it: mid-flare, mid-crisis, mid-diagnosis. When that happens, things get missed: a follow-up nobody rebooks, a lab result nobody connects to a new symptom, a medication change one specialist doesn't know another one made.

Most existing tools treat this as a records problem: store the documents, make them searchable, maybe chat with them. HealthSteward treats it as a coordination problem instead: ingest the documents providers give you, keep track of what's changed and what's still open, and turn that into something concrete to bring into the next appointment. All of it runs locally by default, because a tool asking to hold this much of someone's health history should not require sending that history to a server to be useful.

This isn't a replacement for clinical judgment. It's infrastructure for the part of chronic illness care that currently has none.

## What It Does

- **Health profile management** — conditions (with ICD-10 codes), medications, doctors, appointments
- **AI visit preparation** — generates personalized questions for upcoming doctor visits using Claude API, with intelligent context selection from past visits
- **AVS PDF parsing** — upload after-visit summary PDFs, parse locally with Ollama, review extracted items, and update your profile
- **Proactive action items** — after applying a parsed AVS, surfaces follow-ups to book, labs to get done, and referrals to schedule; persistent "Needs Attention" section on the overview tab with flexible snooze (1w / 2w / 1m), one-click completion, previously-snoozed indicators, and a resolved history toggle
- **PII anonymization** — all data sent to external LLMs is anonymized (names, DOB, contact info removed)
- **Complete privacy** — health data stays local; PDF parsing uses only local Ollama (no PHI leaves your machine)

## Architecture

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | FastAPI + SQLAlchemy (async) + SQLite |
| Frontend | React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Vite |
| AI (agentic) | Claude API (Sonnet) for visit prep |
| AI (local) | Ollama (qwen2.5:7b) for PDF parsing |
| Database | SQLite via aiosqlite, migrations via Alembic |

```

Two LLMs, two trust boundaries: **Ollama runs locally** and never sees the network — it parses raw PDFs and also scores relevance of raw (pre-anonymization) visit history during context selection. **Claude API is remote** and only ever receives the final, already-anonymized context — anonymization happens as the last step before that call, not as a single gate in front of both LLMs.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ (conda or venv)
- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) (for PDF parsing)
- [Anthropic API Key](https://console.anthropic.com/) (optional, for AI visit prep)

### Backend

```bash
# Activate your Python environment
conda activate healthsteward  # or your venv

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run database migrations
python -m alembic upgrade head

# Start the API server
python -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev  # starts on http://localhost:3000
```

### Ollama (for PDF parsing)

```bash
ollama serve
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b
```

### Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Required for AI visit prep (optional if only using PDF parsing)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Defaults (override as needed)
LLM_PROVIDER=claude
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
AVS_PARSER_MODEL=qwen2.5:7b
DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///data/healthsteward.db
```

## Key Features in Detail

### PDF Parsing Flow

```
Drop PDF in data/avs/ → Open Documents tab → Parse locally (Ollama) → Review extracted items → Confirm → Update profile
```

The parser uses a **section-routing architecture**:
- **Deterministic parsers** for structured sections (patient info, medication changes, follow-ups, appointments, diagnoses with ICD codes)
- **Focused LLM calls** for unstructured sections (vitals, lab orders, notes, referrals)
- All LLM calls go to localhost Ollama only — a safety check blocks non-localhost URLs

### Visit Prep

Uses a 4-stage context selection pipeline:
1. Rules-based filtering (same doctor, PCP visits, related specialties)
2. Local LLM relevance scoring (Ollama, if >5 past visits)
3. Token budget management
4. Anonymize and send to Claude for question generation

## Documentation

- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — architectural decision log (DEC-001 through DEC-012)
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` — development conversation history
- `docs/SANDBOX_PROMPT.md` — sandbox experiment prompts

## Data Privacy

All health data stays local. The `.gitignore` protects:
- `data/` (database + AVS PDFs)
- `.env` files
- Log files

PDF parsing uses only local Ollama — no PHI is sent to external services. Visit prep anonymizes all PII before sending to Claude API.
